     <h1 id="history">History of Chocolate</h1>
     <p><span class="chocohistory">It all started in Latin America</span>
Chocolate’s 4,000-year history began in ancient Mesoamerica, present day Mexico. It’s here that the first cacao plants were found. The Olmec, one of the earliest civilizations in Latin America, were the first to turn the cacao plant into chocolate. They drank their chocolate during rituals and used it as medicine.

Centuries later, the Mayans praised chocolate as the drink of the gods. Mayan chocolate was a revered brew made of roasted and ground cacao seeds mixed with chilies, water and cornmeal. Mayans poured this mixture from one pot to another, creating a thick foamy beverage called “xocolatl”, meaning “bitter water.”

By the 15th century, the Aztecs used cocoa beans as currency. They believed that chocolate was a gift from the god Quetzalcoatl, and drank it as a refreshing beverage, an aphrodisiac, and even to prepare for war.</p>

     <p>Organic chocolate means you're buying a regulated treat that has been subject to legal regulations that protect the planet's soils and ecosystems — and you, too. As you may have gathered, organic certification is not given lightly. All organic farms and food companies are thoroughly inspected at least once a year.</p>
